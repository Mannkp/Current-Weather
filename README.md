# Current-Weather-Report
know the weather all around the world Api used from: https://openweathermap.org/api Api used: 1)Current Weather Data 2)Geocoding API

JavaScript concepts used:

1) fetch
2) Async
3) Await
4) DOM Manipulation
5) addEventListener
6) working with Json
please note: in the first version of the app, I have used "Geocoding API" to generate Longitudes and Latitudes of City, and then pass it in API call to provide weather cities in INDIA;

-> I have added another script named as 'simpleWayScript.js' wherein I have passed city name as query to search city weather in API Call. This script logic supports Weather information for locations all around the world!

Therefore, you can try both script files and get weather reports, all one need to do is to uncomment one script file linked to HTML page and comment out other linked file.
